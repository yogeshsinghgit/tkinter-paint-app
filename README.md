## About
This is a simple paint application project made using python, or you can say it a simple white board application in which you can draw things by your mouse cursor movements and save the file in jpg format.

## Required Modules
This project is made using 2 python modules.
1. **tkinter** (used for creating simple GUI applications. ) 
2. **pillow** (Python pillow module is used for image manipulation.)

## Installation
python pillow module is not a built-in module so we first have to install it using the command,

    pip install pillow

## How This App works
This paint application draws oval on the screen using tkinter event handling methods on tkinter canvas widget and for saving the work done we simply take a screen shot of the screen and crop the drawing and save it in jpeg format.
taking screenshot and then crop the image is sounds weird, but there is no other way of saving tkinter canvas widget data in python.

## Contribution

**Happy Coding**
